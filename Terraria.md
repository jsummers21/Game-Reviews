## Summary:
Terraria is a sandbox adventure game developed by Re-Logic where the player can choose to live his/her life playing the game however they please. The player can do multiple things whether it be exploring, fighting, building, or even fishing. There is progress in the game where certain items cannot be accessed until the player defeats a certain boss to make them accessable. There are also different styles in which the player can play the game such as using magic, ranged fighting, melee, or a combination of it all in order to get deeper into the game. Even when the game is thought to be "completed" there are still multiple things the player can do such as upgrading weaponry, building structures, fishing, or even attempting to become the richest player, the possibilities in the game are seamingly endless.

## Final Thoughts:
The game is exciting because there is almost always something to do. You can play with your friends on a server and compete with eachother or play through the game together. Each boss fight has its own difficulty for the player as the better and harder to obtain items are not accessable until specific bosses are slain making it hard for the player each boss fight. It is an enjoyable game and is my personal reccomendation for a 2D sidescroller to play.
