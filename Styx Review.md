### Summary:
Styx: Shards of darkness is a stealth game in which you go around using abilities such as cloning and invisibility or using traps such as falling chandeliers or poisonous foods. In the beginning of the game, you start off in the City of Thieves where you go through an in depth tutorial on how to play the game. It teachers you all the fundamentals such as how to interact with the environment and how to use you abilities to your advantage while going through the first area of the game. While going through the first area there are many situations in which the player either needs to hide from, assassinate, or sneak past the guards giving the player a variety of ways to advance to the next area.
### Final Thoughts:
Overall the game seemed a bit slow paced due to all the stealth and hiding that the player is expected of in the game. The abilities are very unique in a way that they can be used for various situations such as using a clone to distract the guard or if you're stuck in an area using amber eyes to look for anything that you are missing. There is not much combat, pretty much as expected from a stealth game, but there is many ways to eliminate the enemies that hinder the player from advancing.
