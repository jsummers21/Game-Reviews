## Summary:
Stardew Valley is a game about your character, who is tired of working for company, going to a farm his family owns and living his life there. The game has many elements of country life such as farming, fishing, cooking, and such making it so the game has multiple things to do to keep the player entertained. There are also events that occur during the game each season such as egg hunts or dancing, which can create a better experience for the player. It is a very simple game and doesn't require a lot of effort to play so players can just sit back and relax while doing some fishing to pass the time.

## Final Thoughts:
Stardew Valley was a pretty relaxing game to play. It isn't a game that keeps the player excited or overwhelmed but instead creates a nice "sit back and relax" atmosphere where the player could just enjoy the game and maybe watch some TV or listen to music at the same time. The controls were very simple and easy to understand so there wasn't any confusion at the beginning and for some reason, I just found fishing to be the greatest thing ever once I started it. I found the farming rather tedious because it wasted a lot of energy to both plant and water the plants when instead I could be fishing however, doing so makes it easier to make money within the game.
