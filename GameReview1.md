## Summary:
The game is about a scientist named Seth, who created a respawn machine, being attacked by an evil scientist who wants to steal the respawn machine Seth created. Seth has to use the respawn device to escape the evil scientists' minions by throwing the device to relatively safe places, then dying in order to respawn where the device was thrown. There are levels such as the first where Seth is escaping the minions  of the evil scientist from rooftop to rooftop or the second level where Seth is captured and has to escape the facility he is in.

## Final Thoughts:
The game was fun as it did keep me focused on the game. There was a situation where Seth was able to stand on top of the minions head after falling off an elevator and landing on top of the minion. Whether that was intentional of not, it was pretty funny. The game was unique in using death as a way of progression in the game whereas other games use it as an obstacle.
