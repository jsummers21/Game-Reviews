## Summary:
The game is about your character, who is part of the fifth fleet, attempting to learn the reasons for all the Elder Dragons migrating to the new world. The NPCs in the game send you on multiple missions ranging from finding new campsite locations to Jumping on a giant elder dragons back. It consists of constant combat against multiple dragons with different elements, attacks, and abilities that can make the game easier or harder depending on what gear you are wearing at that moment. You have to continuously look for ingredients broken off of the monsters you fight and also found around the enviornment, such as herbs and minerals in order to create better gear/consumables in order to survive better.

## Final Thoughts:
The game was fast pace and was very hard to keep up with the monsters' attacks in the beginning. The ability to switch which weapons your character could use constantly is unique in which it lets you use different playstyles instead of assigning the character a specific class at the beginning of the game. The fights are different each time as some monsters are faster than others but do less damage whereas, some monsters are slower but cause more damage. There are also elements that the monsters have which can determine which weapon or equipment one should use such as the fire element being weak to water or the ice element being weak to fire.
