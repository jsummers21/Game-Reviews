## Summary:
Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 is an FPS shooter with no campaign but instead include multiple gamemodes such as Multiplayer, Zombies and Blackout. Multiplayer has many different modes to play such as Team Deathmatch, Search and Destroy, Free-for-All, and many more. In this gamemode you create a class where you choose which weapon to use, side-arms, passive skills the player can have called perks, and some others however, the amount of customizations you can add to the class are limited by ten customizations. Once the class is created you can enter a game mode and complete the objective given based on what mode is being played. Zombies is another gamemode but instead of customizing your entire class, you have to buy weapons throughout the game while being attacked by zombies. Weapons can still be customized by adding attachments in the menu screen of the game mode but you don't get the weapon at the start but instead have to buy it from the "wall" or the mystery box which gives you a random weapon each time it is used. Using the weapons you buy, you kill your way round after round until finally you are overwhelmed by the zombies. The last gamemode is Blackout which is a battle royale type gamemode where the player can either play the game solo or group up within a limit of four players and fight other people until they are the last ones standing. The game begins with helecopters flying across the map where you jump out, glide using a wingsuit and finally parachute to the ground where you will find weapons around the map to aid the player in obtaining victory.

## Final Thoughts:
The customization available in multiplayer is fun to play around with because you can test all sorts of different weapons to figure out which gun you like best however the limit can be annoying when you have to remove somthing from the class in order to add something else. In zombies, the easter eggs available to accomplish throughout the rounds make the game better overall because just constantly killing zombies over and over until you die can get very repetetive. In Blackout, as it stands, I find boring to play by myself because one person is up against everyone else so if you are up against 4 people versus 1, then the outcome is almost always a loss (maybe Im just bad at the game).
